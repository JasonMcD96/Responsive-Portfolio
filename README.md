# Description

In this project I designed a portfolio about myself and made it responsive to different screen sizes. I was able to accomplish this through the use of Bootstrap's grid system and through media queries. My project also features a navbar at the top of the browser window that collapses once it has been shrunk to a certain point. At that point the buttons turn into a "hamburger" and it drops down the nav options once clicked.
